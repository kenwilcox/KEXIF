KEXIF
=====

A Simple Wrapper For Phil Harvey's exiftool

Written in Delphi 6 a long... long... time ago.

Uses
----
- [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) for the installer - Don't know which version will work
- [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) - Installer includes 7.04 tested with 9.72. Just make sure the Windows exe is named exiftool and it should work.
